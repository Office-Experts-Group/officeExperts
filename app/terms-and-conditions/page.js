        </p>

        <p>

          a Customer fails to pay some or all of the invoiced amount within the
          required payment time (Overdue Amount) then Office Experts Group may,

        <ul>
          <li>

            full;
          </li>
          <li>
            (b) terminate any further provision of the Services (or any other

        <ul>
          <li>
            (a) (GST Recovery) If a Supply under these Terms is subject to GST,

          </li>
          <li>
            (d) (Change in GST amount): If the amount of GST payable on Supplies
