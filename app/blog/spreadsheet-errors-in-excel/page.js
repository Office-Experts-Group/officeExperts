          <h2>Imprisoned by Your Own Cells</h2>
          <p>
            Spreadsheets are the backbone of decision-making in countless
            organisations—from calculating financial projections to tracking
            customer orders, inventory, payroll, and everything in between. But
            here's a fun fact - research shows that{" "}
            <strong>88% of spreadsheets contain errors!</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            These aren't just minor typos or formatting issues. In many cases,
            they're critical errors that can lead to poor decisions, regulatory
            breaches, or massive financial losses. Most businesses don't even
            know these errors exist until it's too late. Sometimes a tiny
            mistake can have major consequences, in 2012, JP Morgan lost $6B due
            to a copying error in Excel!
          </p>

            <p>
              A simple spreadsheet error at Kodak led to an $11 million
              overstatement in severance... for just one lucky employee. It's
              unclear what happened to the person who made the mistake, but
              their own severance was likely far less generous.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>
            So... Why is this still happening in 2025? Mostly because
            spreadsheets are often developed without formal processes, tested by
            their creators, albeit, never reviewed by others. Crucially they
            evolve over time with little documentation and bandaids covering old
            wounds. They become essential tools... Yet sit quietly in the
            background, trusted without question.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this article, we'll uncover just how dangerous spreadsheet errors
            can be, why they're so common, and what your business can do to
            avoid the hidden risks before they spiral out of control.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Spreadsheet Errors Are So Common</h2>
          <p>
            Spreadsheets are incredibly powerful tools, but they're also
            incredibly easy to get wrong. One reason they're so prone to error,
            to put it bluntly, is that the barrier to entry is low... Anyone
            with a computer can start building{" "}
            <Link href="https://www.excelexperts.com.au/excel-formulas-and-custom-formulas">
              formulas
            </Link>
            ,{" "}
            <Link href="https://www.excelexperts.com.au/pivot-tables-charts-and-reporting-solutions">
              pivot tables
            </Link>
            , and
            <Link href={"/services/by-business-solution/dashboards"}>
              {" "}
              dashboards
            </Link>
            . But without proper training, most people rely on guesswork, trial
            and error, or copying formulas from other spreadsheets without fully
            understanding them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, as the spreadsheets evolve, what started as a simple
            calculation grows into a sprawling file with dozens of interlinked
            tabs, hidden assumptions, and outdated logic. Often, there's no
            clear documentation, naming conventions, or guidance for future
            users. As a result, changes made months or years prior become a
            ticking time bomb, at this point, no one remembers how the
            spreadsheet even works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike software development, spreadsheets rarely use version control
            or audit trails. There's no way to see who changed what, when, or
            why. Mistakes can be made and overwritten without anyone noticing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most commonly, many businesses rely on a single "Excel champion"—a
            team member who understands the system inside and out. But when that
            person leaves or changes roles, the organisation is left with a
            mysterious entity, a labyrinth of hidden functions and formulas of
            unknown origin, nor use case. Even well-meaning replacements may
            struggle to untangle the logic, starting all over again might be
            unrealistic, so its guess work and bandaid time again.
          </p>
          <p>
            These conditions make even simple spreadsheets vulnerable to silent,
            compounding errors. Consider the case of the University of Toledo,
            where a single formula mistake led to a $2.4 million misprojection
            in tuition revenue. Or the Emerson Construction Company, who nearly
            lost a $37 million government contract due to overlooking a single
            cell in their bid estimate.

          <h2>Signs You Might Have a Spreadsheet Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Spreadsheet issues often go unnoticed until they trigger a crisis.
            But with a bit of awareness, it's possible to spot the red flags
            early and take corrective action. Here are some telltale signs that
            your organisation might have a spreadsheet problem:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Broken links or #REF errors:</strong> These are not just
              technical annoyances—they often signal broken logic, missing data,
              or structural flaws in how spreadsheets are built and maintained.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Single point of failure:</strong> If there's only one
              person who truly understands how a spreadsheet works, that's a
              major risk. What happens if they go on leave or leave the business
              altogether?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Unreviewed critical decisions:</strong> Are you using
              Excel files to make budgeting, staffing, or compliance decisions
              without a second set of eyes? Lack of peer review opens the door
              to costly mistakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance issues:</strong> Does the file take ages to
              open or update? That's often a sign of bloated formulas,
              inefficient design, or hidden data issues.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If any of these points sound familiar, it's time for a thorough
            audit, or even a professional spreadsheet health check.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Prevent Costly Spreadsheet Errors</h2>
          <p>
            So that's the bad news, the good news is that spreadsheet errors are
            preventable—with the right structure, tools, and mindset. Here are
            some strategies to reduce your risk and improve accuracy in your
            next project:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Implement consistent naming conventions and data validation:
              </strong>{" "}
              A standardised naming system helps others (and future you!)
              understand spreadsheet logic quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Lock sensitive cells and protect critical formulas:
              </strong>{" "}
              Prevent accidental overwrites by locking down the most important
              formulas and reference cells.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Use Excel's built-in auditing tools:</strong> Excel offers
              advanced tools like the Formula Auditing toolbar, Error Checking,
              and Trace Precedents/Dependents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Automate and document recurring tasks:</strong> If you run
              the same report every week or reconcile data monthly? Automate the
              workflow with Power Query,{" "}
              <Link href="/services/microsoft-vbscript ">VBA</Link>, or scripts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Schedule regular spreadsheet audits:</strong> Just like
              financial audits, spreadsheet audits can identify hidden errors,
              inefficiencies, and risks.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Spreadsheet errors are far more common than most businesses
            realise—and the consequences can be severe. From minor reporting
            mistakes to multi-million-dollar losses, the risks are real,
            persistent, and often hidden in plain sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            But these risks are not inevitable. With the right practices, tools,
            and expert guidance, they can be dramatically reduced or even
            eliminated. If there is one thing to take from this article it is
            that <strong>Prevention is ALWAYS better then the cure.</strong> A
            solid foundation in your spreadsheet design can really future proof
            your documents and streamline your business.
